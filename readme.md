- Once the Cube is obtained it is possible to farm runes from the Countess and get the Lore runeword by upgrading to get Ort and Sol but it will be a grind at this point which is especially useful for Druids<br>
- **Duriel** - Drink Antidotes and Thawing Potions (3 each as their durations do stack) for you and your mercenary to boost your Poison and Cold resistance and you should be able to stay alive long enough to kill the boss<br>
- You can buy a Belt to get 3 potion rows from Fara<br>
- Act 1 and 2 in Normal are the only two places where NPCs will sell open sockets on gear, keep an eye out for a 3 open socket shield for Ancient’s Pledge later on
